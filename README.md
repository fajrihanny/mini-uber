# mini-uber

This is a small Twilio app to demonstrate the ability of Twilio Proxy API.

Objective:
By connecting to a Twilio number, the initial caller/texter (could be driver/customer) can communicate with the second user (could be the driver/customer too) via masked communication

Workflow:
- The first user will initiate the masked conversation by sending sms/call to Twilio number
- The SMS/call will activate the masked conversation between the first and second user by utilizing Twilio Proxy API
